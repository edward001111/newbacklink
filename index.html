    <h1>TikTok Warns US Ban Would 'Trample Free Speech'</h1>
    <div class="article-content">
      <p>TikTok says a potential ban on its app in the US would "trample the free speech" of 170 million Americans. The US House of Representatives voted on Saturday to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68867732"> ban TikTok if the app's owner </a>   does not cut its ties with China. The legislation was part of a US foreign policy package that included aid for Ukraine and could become law as early as next week.</p>
      
      <p>In recent months US officials have voiced alarm over TikTok's popularity with young people. They allege TikTok's owner Bytedance is subservient to Beijing - accusations it has repeatedly denied.</p>
      
      <p>The TikTok legislation was included in a package, approved by lawmakers, that would send $61bn (£49bn) in foreign aid to Ukraine, as well as money for Israel and Taiwan. The House of Representatives voted on TikTok's future first - with 360 to 58 voting on the updated divest-or-ban bill.</p>

        <p>"It would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate seven million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24bn (£19.4bn) to the US economy annually."</p>

      <p>A spokesman for TikTok denounced the bill, saying it "would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate seven million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24bn (£19.4bn) to the US economy annually". TikTok has said ByteDance "is not an agent of China or any other country". And ByteDance insists it is not a Chinese firm, pointing to the many global investment firms that own 60% of it.</p>

      <p>Speaking ahead of Saturday's vote, Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi told the BBC's World Business Report programme that they want the app to continue. "I think that it still has a lot of good content," he said. "But most important thing is that it's not under the control or operation of an adversary country."</p>
